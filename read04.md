# javascript 
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions 
### uses 
- Web pages
-  many non-browser, such as Node.js and Adobe Acrobat
### Java and JavaScript
the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantic, and use.
### The standards for JavaScript
* the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402)

### Creating HTML is cumbersome
* Even in such a simple HTML we wanted to create we had to use + several time and the code is quite unreadable. 

* In the back-end systems written in Perl, Python or Ruby, people have encountered the same problem and the solution was the creation of various templating engines.

* Basically a template would be an HTML snippet with some place holders and then a function call that gets the HTML snippet (the template) as a parameter, and gets several key-value pairs. The function then returns a new HTML snippet in which the place holders were replaced by the value of the appropriate key.
